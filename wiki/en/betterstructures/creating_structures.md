## Creating the build

There are no restrictions with what you can build for BetterStructures, although it is recommended to keep the size of the structures under 100x100x100 blocks for general world fit and performance reasons. That being said, it can easily handle structure much larger structures.

***

### Special blocks

BetterStructures has two special blocks: barriers and bedrock. Any other block that WorldEdit can paste will be pasted normally, but barriers and bedrock blocks are the exception. Instead of pasting, these blocks get replaced with the following custom behaviors:

***

#### Barrier

Barrier blocks make the plugin not place any blocks at that location. This means that whatever block was originally there in the normal world generation will remain there.

Builders can use this to round the edges of a paste, making it look more natural, or to mold walls to a potential cave, among other tricks.

***

#### Bedrock

Bedrock blocks make the plugin guarantee that there is a solid block at that location. This means that if a solid block is already there in the default world generation, that block will not be modified; however, if the block is air or liquid, it will be replaced with a solid block from the [pedestal](#pedestalmaterial).

Builders can use this to create floors with features such as the floor for minecart rails or guarantee that a floor exists without overriding potentially already existing solid blocks at that location in the world, making the builds look more organic.

***

### Spawn signs

BetterStructures can use signs with specific text to spawn mobs and even bosses from EliteMobs and MythicMobs at specific locations of the build.

***

##### Spawning vanilla mobs

If you take a normal sign and place it somewhere, then make sure the first line says `[spawn]` and the second line has the [entity type name following the Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html) you will spawn a persistent entity at that location of the type you specified.

As an example, if you have a sign that says `[spawn]` on the first line and `ZOMBIE` on the second line, you will spawn a zombie at that location when the build gets placed. This can also be used for non-living entities such as armor stands or ender crystals.

<div class="minecraft-sign"> 
<p>[spawn]</p>
<p>ZOMBIE</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>

***

##### Spawning Elite Mobs (recommended boss plugin)

BetterStructures also has advanced EliteMobs integration, which allows it to create boss arenas based on builds and spawn signs.

If you take a normal sign and place it somewhere, making the first line [elitemobs] then you can use all other lines to say what boss file to use.

As an example, if you do `[elitemobs]` on the first line and then `test_boss.yml`, on the second line, you will spawn the test boss. If you have a very long filename such as boss_with_very_long_filename.yml, you can break it up into multiple lines, so make line 2 `boss_with_very_` and then line 3 `long_filename.yml` and that will work.

As a reminder, by default the combat arenas will be protected until players kill all the bosses in the build if your server is using WorldGuard.

<div class="minecraft-sign"> 
<p>[elitemobs]</p>
<p>test_boss_with</p>
<p>_a_long_name</p>
<p>.yml</p>
</div>

***

##### Spawning MythicMobs

If you take a normal sign and place it somewhere, making the first line [mythicmobs] then you can use all other lines to say what boss file to use.

As an example, if you do `[mythicmobs]` on the first line, `SkeletalKnight`, on the second line, and then the level `10`, on the third line, you will spawn the SkeletalKnight boss at level 10.

<div class="minecraft-sign"> 
<p>[mythicmobs]</p>
<p>SkeletalKnight</p>
<p>10</p>
</div>

## Schematics

Schematics are files generated by WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit which contain the blocks for the build that BetterStructures will be using. 

Detailed instructions on how to make a schematic are not included here, as they are thoroughly detailed on the WorldEdit and FastAsyncWorldEdit documentations, but it is generally done by:

1) pick a corner of the build and use the command `//pos1`
2) pick the diagonally opposite corner and use the command `//pos2`
3) use the `//copy` command
4) use the command `/schem save <schematicname>` where `<schematicName>` is the filename you want to use for your schematic.

*Make sure you run the command `//pos1` on point 1 and `//pos2` on point 2!*

***

#### Anchor point

Anchor points are where you run the `//copy` command for the schematic. When simply pasting a schematic, these are where you are standing relative to the build.

Anchor points are important to get right for the schematics to work correctly.

* For _surface builds_, it is recommended you stand at the lowest point of the floor when copying the build.
* For _underground builds_, it is recommended you stand on top of the build.
* For _liquid builds_, it is recommended you stand on top of the water.
* For _air builds_, it is recommended that you stand on top of the build.

**Please note that you should always be very close or directly on top of the builds when copying - the farther away you are, the laggier it will be when the build needs to be pasted.**

***

# Schematic configurations

Every schematic file has a schematic configuration. If a schematic file has just been added to the server, the configuration will be generated after a restart or after a `/betterstructures reload`.

These configurations allow you to set the following settings for the schematic paste:

***

## isEnabled

Sets whether the schematic is enabled. If disabled, it will not be placed anywhere.

***

## weight

Weight sets the weight of the schematic in terms of how likely it is to get picked.

The default value is `1.0`. If you make a build have a `2.0` weight, it will be 2x more likely of getting selected than the other builds. If you make it `0.5`, it will have half the chances of getting picked.

_**Note:** Keep in mind that the odds of a specific build getting picked change drastically based on how many build there are in total competing for the location that will be getting a structure!_

***

## pedestalMaterial

**Important: optional field!**

Pedestal material sets the material type of the pedestal blocks using the [spigot api material names](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html) - use them or it won't work!

Pedestals are the blocks that get placed under surface and underground buildings to fit any air gaps and improve a building's fit with the world. These are also the same blocks that replace bedrock blocks in the schematic.

When nothing is defined in the configuration, the blocks under the location for the paste get analyzed and the best fit gets selected as the material for the best integrated look.

***

## generatorConfigFilename

This option sets the name of the configuration file, by file name, that the schematic will be using. This requires the full filename, including the `.yml` extension at the end. As an example, `generatorConfigFilename: generator_surface_global.yml` would be the correct option if you want to use the generator defined in `generator_surface_global.yml` which you can find in the generators configuration folder.

***

## treasureFile

Sets the [treasure file]($language$/betterstructures/creating_treasure.md) that this structure will use, overwriting the treasure file set by the structure's [generator]($language$/betterstructures/creating_generators.md). This is generally not recommended unless it is for a very special build. It is generally better to modify or create a generator for this purpose.


# Customizing content

Everything distributed in BetterStructures is editable. You are able to modify any schematic files and generator settings to your liking.

The content creation guide above is also a guide that can help you edit existing content.
