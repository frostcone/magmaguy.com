This dungeon is part of the Story Mode Dungeon series. Players can embark on quests that weave a continuous narrative through the dungeons, offering a cohesive and immersive storyline.

At the heart of this desolation stands a grotesque creation—born from the collapsing energies of the Nether over centuries—an abomination known as the Void Bell. Its incessant ringing and chimes weave a sinister promise into the minds of those who hear it, tempting them with unimaginable riches and powers. Its resonation echoes deep within, a haunting presence that refuses to be shaken.

Premium purchases on [magmaguy.itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) are permanent; however, you have to purchase everything individually.

[patreon.com/magmaguy](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy) supporters get temporary access to my premium content (depending on tier, at $15 it includes everything I've ever made) for as long as they keep the subscription active. Once the subscription is cancelled, access to the download links, updates and future content posted on Patreon is stopped. Patrons can choose to reactivate their patronage at any time.

# Dungeon Types

***Note: the following describes the premade content of EliteMobs. What you do in your server can be customized, and the features described below are simply a convenient way of grouping different types of content up.*** The content you make for your server can follow entirely different formats and rules.

## Open dungeons

Open dungeons are always open to all players. This means that any amount of players can enter the dungeon at any time to fight the same bosses. This is great for casual grouping up and farming, but can be complicated due to respawn timers.

For WoW / FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of open-world zones with world bosses.

### What's a Lair?
Lairs are a type of small dungeon which focuses on one big boss fight.

The structure: Lairs are usually restricted to a build around a big combat arena, and are the smallest size category of EliteMobs.

The fights: Players are expected to group up in groups of 5 to challenge the boss, as they are usually very challenging.

For FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of world bosses.

### What's a Minidungeon?
Minidungeons are a type of medium sized dungeon which usually contains 3-15 minibosses and a big boss, as well as a lot of "trash" mobs which are meant to be "farmed" for coins and gear by players.

The structure: The smallest minidungeons are the size of large ships, and the largest minidungeon can be quite expansive maps with hundreds of mobs roaming around for fights.

The fights: Minidungeons can be solo'd by veteran players, but groups of 2-3 players are recommended.

For WoW / FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of world bosses in zones that are challenging but rewarding to farm.

### What's an Adventure?
Adventures are full adventure maps. They include quests lines, npcs, large amounts of minibosses and bosses and can even contain their own arenas or dungeons inside of them.

The structure: These are always very large maps with dozens of large builds split off into different zones. They can also include secondary and tertiary worlds for several reasons.

The fights: Adventures can be solo'd by veteran players, but grouping up another player is recommended.

For WoW / FF14 fans, this is essentially the whole base game of questing and finding dungeons and fighting bosses along a questline.

## Instanced dungeons

Instanced dungeons are dungeons that create worlds as needed, allowing server to run as many simultaneous fights for as many players as necessary. It is the best option to create hard but fair content, and is the least exploitable type of content.

There are lot of features to Instanced Dungeons, which you can read about [here]($language$/elitemobs/instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md&section=how-it-works).

For WoW and FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of dungeons / duties instancing.

### Sanctums
Sanctums are the equivalent of instanced Lairs. This means that they focus around one huge boss fight. This is the hardest type of EliteMobs content, especially for the harder difficulties.

The structure: THese are usually small maps but can have very dynamic combat arenas. They are usually focused around a single large room.

The fights: Supposed to be fought by 5 players. At the highest difficulties, this is the hardest EliteMobs content there is.

For FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of Trials.

### Dungeons
Dungeons are the equivalent of instanced Minidungeons. This the the most traditional MMORPG type of dungeon, where players party up and go through a gauntlet of trash mobs and minibosses to fight a final boss.

For WoW and FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of Dungeons.

The structure: These are usually medium-sized maps, larger than minidungeons but much smaller than Adventures.

The fights: Supposed to be fought by parties of 5, harder than open dungeons but easier than Sanctums.
