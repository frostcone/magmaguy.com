# Creating custom bosses

# Before you begin

## Where do boss files go?

Boss files go into the configuration folder `~/plugins/EliteMobs/custombosses`.

It is possible to create subfolders, such as `~/plugins/EliteMobs/custombosses/mybosses`. This is recommended to keep things organized.

One file defines one boss, though it is possible to spawn the same boss several times and even set several spawn locations for the same boss file.

It is possible to use the [webapp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html) to quickly and easily create custom bosses and more.

## Smallest possible configuration

**The smallest possible configuration file for a Custom Boss is:**
```yml
```

Note how this is just an empty file. This will still spawn a zombie custom boss with a custom name, as those are the defaults. **Everything in this page is optional!**

## Example boss

<div align="center">

Let's take a look at an example of what a boss file looks like.

## Basic settings

<div align="center">

### isEnabled

Sets if the boss is enabled.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `isEnabled` | `true` / `false` | `true` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
isEnabled: true
```

</div>

</details>

***

### entityType

Sets the entity type of the boss.

| Key |                                                                                   Values                                                                                    | Default |

| `entityType` | [Pick from here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html). <br> Value must also be present in folder `~plugins/EliteMobs/mobproperties`. | `ZOMBIE`|

<details> 

<summary><b>Magma Cubes and Slimes</b></summary>

<div align="left">

Since these entity types do not attack players directly, but instead pull them in and deal damage rapidly, they can cause large bursts of damage in a short time. Because of this, we generally do not recommend using them as Elite mobs frequently. However, if you still wish to use them, we suggest setting `damageMultiplier` to around `0.1`.

We also recommend using the following EliteScript to prevent Magma Cubes or Slimes from stun-locking players:

```yml
eliteScript:
  NerfDamage:
    Events:
    - ZoneEnterEvent
    - ZoneLeaveEvent
    Zone:
      shape: SPHERE
      radius: 1
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
    Actions:
    - action: SET_MOB_AI
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
      bValue: false
      duration: 10
```

### helmet/chestplate/leggings/boots/mainhand/offhand

Sets the armor of the boss. Not all minecraft models are able to show armor. Boss armor is purely cosmetic and does not affect gameplay.

| Key |                                    Values                                     | Default |
|-|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-|
| `helmet` |           [Material](#material), [UUID](https://minecraftuuid.com/)           | none |
| `chestplate` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `leggings` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `boots` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `mainHand` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `offHand` | [Material](#material) | none |

**Note:** This field also lets you set custom models for items. To set the custom model ID, add the ID after the material type following this format: `ITEM_MATERIAL:ID`. Example: `DIAMOND_SWORD:1` sets the boss to wear a diamond sword with the custom model #1 in your texture pack.

**Note 2:** This field also lets you set custom leather colors with the format `ITEM_MATERIAL:CODE` where the code is the hexadecimal representation of the color. Example: `LEATHER_LEGGINGS:ffa500` would create orange leggings. You can use hex codes, just remove the `#` from the hex code. You can get hex codes from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).

**Note 3:** The helmet field also lets you set mob helmets to be player heads. Simply get the UUID of the player head you would like to use and type it into the helmet field. *The player needs to be online for this to work or the head will default to a generic MineCraft head.* You can get player UUID's from [here](https://minecraftuuid.com/).

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
helmet: 198c4123-cafc-45df-ba79-02a421eb8ce7
chestplate: DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE:1
leggings: LEATHER_LEGGINGS:ffa500

<div align="center">

![create_boss_mounted.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_boss_mounted.jpg)

</div>

</div>

</details>

Note: Regional bosses will share their leash with the entity they're mounting, meaning they'll both be dragged back to the spawn location if they exceed the distance allowed by their leash.

***

### announcementPriority

Sets the priority level for announcements. Lower priorities mean no announcements are made, higher priorities can announce not only on chat but also on discord if configured.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `announcementPriority` | [Integer](#integer) | `1` |

Here is a list of what the priorities do:

| Value |                                                                            Description                                                                            |
|-|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `0` |                                                   The boss will be fully silent, with no announcement messages.                                                   |
| `1` |                                This is the default. Bosses can send chat messages, on spawn message, on death and escape messages.                                |
| `2` |                               On top of the things in `1`, the boss will be set to be trackable by players through the `/em` menu.                                |
| `3` | On top of the things in `2`, broadcast messages will be mirrored on Discord if configured. [Discord configuration info here.]($language$/elitemobs/discordsrv.md) |

Here's an example of a boss that is trackable, is able to send spawn/death/escape messages on chat and on Discord:

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
announcementPriority: 3
```

</div>

</details>

**Note**: You will have to configure the spawnMessage, deathMessage/deathMessages, escapeMessage for chat and discord announcements and the locationMessage for the tracking feature if you wish to use the corresponding Announcement Priority level.

***

### followDistance

Set the distance at which bosses aggro and enter combat.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `followDistance` | [Double](#double) | none, uses defaults from Minecraft |

Note 1: Regional bosses have half the `followDistance` when out of combat. This is so they don't aggro from too far away, which can cause annoying combat issues due to leash constraints.

Note 2: The higher the `followDistance`, the more intensive on the server CPU the boss becomes. Use carefully and responsibly!

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
followDistance: 30
```

</div>

Sets a range of 30 blocks where if a player gets within that distance near the boss it will start chasing/attacking the player.

</details>

***

### onDeathCommands

Sets the list of commands to run on custom boss death.

| Key |        Values        | Default |
|-|:--------------------:|-|
| `onDeathCommands` | [List](#string_list) | none |

The list supports the following placeholders:

| Value | Description |
|-|:-:|
| `$level` | Placeholder for the boss level. |
| `$name` | Placeholder for the boss name. |
| `$chance=x$` | Makes a command have a chance to run. |
| `$players` | Makes the command run once for every player in the damagers list and replaces each time with the username of a different player on that list. |
| `$locationX` | X coordinate of the boss at the time of death. |
| `$locationY` | Y coordinate of the boss at the time of death. |
| `$locationZ` | Z coordinate of the boss at the time of death. |
| `$damager1name` | Username of the top damager |
| `$damager2name` | Username of the second top damager |
| `$damager3name` | Username of the third top damager |

Take a look at the example below to get a better understanding of how these work.

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
onDeathCommands:
- "say $players has killed $name! That was level $level!"
- "$chance=0.5$ say What a kill!"
```

<div align="center">

![create_boss_mounted.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_boss_ondeathcommands.jpg)

</div>

</div>

If Player1, Player2 and Player3 all damaged the boss before killing it, this is what the command output will be from console:

<div align="left">

```
say Player1 has killed CustomBossName! That was level X!
say Player2 has killed CustomBossName! That was level X!
say Player3 has killed CustomBossName! That was level X!
```

</div>

<div align="left">

```
say What a kill!
```

</div>

</details>

### song

Sets the music a boss will play, starting when it spawns. Requires the .ogg file for the song to be in the resource pack.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `song` | [String](#string) | none |

**Note: The `song` setting requires `followDistance` to be set, as `followDistance` determines the range at which the song starts playing.**
Check out the example on how to set the `length` (milliseconds) of the `song`.

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

There are two ways to set up songs. Here is the first one:

<div align="left">

```yml
song: name=elitemobs:ice_queen.idle length=76370
```

</div>

This will play the song ice_queen.idle for 76370 milliseconds and then loop it. Note that the location of the song is determined by the resource pack.

Here is the second way of setting up songs:

<div align="left">

```yml
song: name=elitemobs:ice_queen.end_transition length=14328->name=elitemobs:ice_queen.end_loop length=28657
```

This will play the song ice_queen.end_transition for 14328 milliseconds and then transition to ice_queen.end_loop for 28657 milliseconds and loop the end_loop.

This allows bosses to have an "intro" or "transition" song and then a main track that loops.

</div>

## Boss phases

<div align="center">

Bosses can have phases that change when the boss reaches a certain percentage of health. When this happens, the boss starts using a different configuration file, meaning that everything about the boss can change, including things like the entity type.
</br>To learn more about boss phases click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_boss_phases.md).


| Key | Description | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|-|
| `phases` | Sets the phases that the boss will have. Mandatory | [List](#string_list) | none |
| `phaseSpawnLocation` | Sets where the phase boss spawns. Optional | [String](#string) | none |


<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

For this example, we are going to show three different configuration files.

First boss configuration file: phase_1_boss.yml

```yml
name: "Phase 1"
entityType: ZOMBIE
phases:
- phase_2_boss.yml:0.60
- phase_3_boss.yml:0.30
```

Second boss configuration file: phase_2_boss.yml

```yml
name: "Phase 2"
entityType: SKELETON
```

Third boss configuration file: phase_3_boss.yml

```yml
name: "Phase 3"
phaseSpawnLocation: same_as_boss,10,64,100,0,0
entityType: RAVAGER
```

</div>

This boss would change to the configuration file `phase_2_boss.yml` at 60% health, and to the configuration file `phase_3_boss.yml` at 30% health in the same world as phase 2 and at coordinates x=10, y=64 and z=100. The entity type and name of the boss would also change.

The format for an entry is `filename:healthPercentage`.

phaseSpawnLocation is optional, if it is not set the boss will change phases where it's standing.

</details>

The following things are important to know when designing a phase boss:

<div align="left">

- The configuration file for the first phase sets all phases of the boss.
- Threat / damage counted is kept between phases for players.
- Switching phases is based on the percentage of health lost, which is preserved when switching to a different phase. This means increasing or decreasing the healthMultiplier between phases will not heal or damage the boss, it will still switch with the same percentage, but will have more or less health for that phase.
- Phase bosses revert to phase 1 if they go out of combat.
- Phase bosses which are also regional bosses share the same leash radius and timeout mechanic across all phases, and will respawn as the phase 1 boss when the timer is finished.
- The configuration file for the last phase sets the loot for the boss.
- Phases can not be skipped - overkill damage will still make the boss switch phases at the percentage defined.
- Phase bosses that have mounts cease to be mounted when switching phases.

</div>

</div>

</div>

***

## Regional bosses

<div align="center">

Regional bosses are a specific type of Custom Bosses that spawn at a specific configured location and are able to respawn at that location after a delay. Additionally, they can have leashes that make sure they stay in a specific zone, among other features.

These are used for all of the dungeon content. To learn more about regional bosses click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_world_bosses.md).

| Key | Description | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|:-:|-|
| `isRegionalBoss` | Sets if the boss is regional. Should be true if you want a regional boss.  | `true` /  `false` | `false` |
| `spawnLocation` | Sets the spawn locations of the boss.  | Add these through the `/em addSpawnLocation [filename.yml]` command! | none |
| `spawnCooldown` | Sets the respawn cooldown of the boss, in <b>minutes</b>. | [Integer](#integer) | `0` |
| `leashRadius` | Sets the distance the boss can go from its spawn point before getting pulled back. | [Double](#double) | none |
| `onSpawnBlockStates` | Sets the blocks the boss will modify when it spawns. | Check commands below | none |
| `onRemoveBlockStates` | Sets the blocks the boss will modify when it despawns. | Check commands below | none |

As indicated, Regional Bosses can have `onSpawnBlockStates` and `onRemoveBlockStates`.

This is a very useful feature for modifying combat arenas during combat, especially when combined with phase switches, as it becomes possible to open and close combat arenas through changing block states.

The format for these is too complex to write manually, so a few commands exist to help you set them up:

| Command | Description |
|-|:-:|

<div align="left">

Let's say you want to make a fight where a boss spawns in an arena that has an open door, and you want to make it so the door closes when the fight starts and reopens when the fight is over.

To do this, you will need two boss phases and to register three different sets of block states. For this example, I will name these phases phase_1_boss.yml and phase_2_boss.yml respectively.

1) Use `/em registerblocks phase_1_boss.yml on_spawn` or `/em registerblocksedit phase_1_boss.yml on_spawn` to register the door blocks in their open state.

This means registering the air blocks. Area selection is recommended here.

This is necessary to make sure that the door is open when the boss spawns so players are guaranteed to have a way in.

2) Use `/em registerblocks phase_2_boss.yml on_spawn` or `/em registerblocksedit phase_2_boss.yml on_spawn` to register the door blocks in their closed state.

This means registering the solid blocks of the door that would prevent the player from leaving.

This is necessary to change the door to be solid when the boss enters phase 2, preventing players from leaving.

3) Use `/em registerblocks phase_2_boss.yml on_remove` or `/em registerblocksedit phase_2_boss.yml on_remove` to register the door blocks in their open state.

This means registering the same blocks from the first step again (the air blocks).

This is necessary to open the door when the boss dies, allowing players to leave the arena.

### alert

<div align="center">

Sets whether the boss is alert. By default, Regional Bosses are slowed and have a shorter aggro distance when they are out of combat. This setting prevents Regional Bosses from being slowed and having a shorter aggro distance while outside of combat, so they will always behave the same way in or out of combat.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `alert` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `true` |

### removeAfterDeath

<div align="center">

Sets whether the Regional Boss will be permanently deleted after being killed. This is what BetterStructures uses for Shrines, where the Regional Boss is only designed to be fought against once and then never again at that location.

## Instanced bosses

<div align="center">

Instanced bosses are a subtype of Regional Bosses used in Instanced Dungeons.

| Key | Description | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|-|
| `instanced` | Makes the custom boss instanced. Mandatory. | `true` / `false` | `false` |


Setting bosses to instanced is mandatory for instanced dungeons to work correctly. We also recommend removing leashes for any instanced bosses.
