# User commands

*Note: All player permissions are set to be true by default. This means that they are already set up.*

*If you do not want players to have access to a specific feature via permissions, you will have to deny that player the permission!*

| Command |    Description    |
|---------|:-----------------:|
| `/elitemobs` / `/em` | Main command, condenses all player info in the plugin in an easy to access menu. *Note:* all other user commands are in this main command. |

| `/em shareItem`     |Links an item in chat so other players may see its stats.|

| `/em pay <username> <amount>`     |Lets players pay each other. Transactions are taxed a configurable amount.|

## NPC commands

These commands are only useful if you do not have the Adventurer's Guild Hub with NPCs installed. 

It is recommended you install these to run all of these commands through NPCs instead of having players remember how the commands work.

| `/em rank`     |     Opens the rank menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em shop procedural <player>`     |     Accesses the shop or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild Hub.     |
| `/em shop sell <player>`     |     Accesses the shop sell menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild Hub.     |
| `/em shop custom <player>`     |     Accesses the custom shop or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em repair`     |     Accesses the repair menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |

| `/em scrap`     |     Accesses the scrap menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em unbind`     |     Accesses the unbind menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |

## Internal user commands

**These commands are meant to be run from in-game menus such as quests from the quest menu. If no instructions are written about how to get an ID, then that means it is not possible to get that ID other than by running the command from the in-game menu.** For convenience, these have been split into the identifiable and unidentifiable categories.

### Identifiable

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|`/em dungeontp <dungeonid>`         |Teleports a player to a dungeon.|
*Note: this is meant to be run from the `/em` menu, as it is impossible for players to guess dungeon IDs. The IDs of the dungeons are the same as the .yml filenames in `~/plugins/EliteMobs/dungeonpackages/`. <br/>You can see the IDs on console when using the `/em` command and pick a teleport from the Teleports page.*

### Unidentifiable

| Command | Description |
|---------|:-----------:|
| `/em quest accept <questID>`     |     Accepts a quest.     |
| `/em quest track <questID>`     |     Tracks a quest.     |
| `/em quest complete <questID>`     |     Completes a quest.     |
| `/em quest leave <questID>`     |     Leaves a quest.     |
| `/em track boss <uuid>`     |     Tracks a custom boss. Note: this is meant to be run from the `/em` menu, as it is impossible for players to guess boss UUIDs.     |
